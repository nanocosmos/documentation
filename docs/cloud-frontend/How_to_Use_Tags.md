:::caution We upgraded to V3
With the release of nanoStream Cloud 2022, it is now even easier to create and manage live streams, especially for Adaptive Bitrate and secure streams! <br/>

**Find the documentation of V3 [here](../cloud-frontend-v3/Dashboard_Overview).**

Tags are a helpful tool to organize your streams. They can be used to search for specific streams in your stream list.

## Update Tags

Stream tags can be updated in the *Stream Overview*. To access the *Stream Overview*, click *Streams* in the left sidebar to update the tags of your streams.

Click the stream that you want to update and you'll be redirected to its *Stream Overview*.

Now click *Update Tags* to update the tags of the stream.

Stream tags can also be added on the *Create new Stream* screen when setting up a new stream.

## Create Tags

When updating stream tags, it's also possible to create new tags.

![create tags](../assets/cloud-frontend-v2/create-tags.png)

While typing in the desired stream tag, you are be able to choose from existing tags (in the picture above: *Test Tag 2* and *Test Tag*) or create a new tag by pressing enter.

![create tag](../assets/cloud-frontend-v2/create-tag2.png)

In the example the tag *Test* was added by pressing enter. This tag can now be assigned to any of your other streams, too.

## Search for Streams

To find streams using their assigned tags, click on *Streams* in the menu bar on the left side of the page.

Now click *Search* and *Search Tags* to insert the tags that you want to search for.

This allows you to find streams in your stream list by their assigned tags.
