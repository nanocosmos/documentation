:::caution We upgraded to V3
With the release of nanoStream Cloud 2022, it is now even easier to create and manage live streams, especially for Adaptive Bitrate and secure streams! <br/>

**Find the documentation of V3 [here](../dashboard/overview).**

Embedding a live stream into your own website is really simple. Every nanoStream has its unique code snippet that is updated automatically to your setup - you only have to copy and paste it to the right place.

## Finding the nanoPlayer Code Snippet

The nanoStream H5Live Player Code Snippet can be found in the *Stream Overview* of the stream that you want to embed. You can find the *Stream Overview* from your stream list. Click on *Streams* on the left side of the homepage to find a list with all of your created streams.
