## nanoAVC/H.264 DirectShow Decoding SDK

### Introduction

nanoAVC/H.264 Direct Show Decoding SDK enables you to decode/play back
AVC/H.264 video and AAC audio from MP4/3GP or transport stream (TS) sources
within Windows Media Player and custom applications based on Microsoft DirectShow Framework.

The nanocosmos H.264/AVC Video Decoder supports streams in baseline, main and high profile. It is highly optimized for use on hyper-threading and multi core systems.

### Registering and unregistering components in the DirectShow framework

In order to use them, filters must be registered in the DirectShow framework. After installation all filters are registered. To re-register or unregister components, execute the RegisterFilters.bat or UnregisterFilters.bat batch files from the SDK/bin folder.

### Evaluation mode and filter activation

Filters can be activated by installing a license key to windows registry or programmatically by setting a license key through the software interface of a filter instance. How to set license keys to unlock filters is described in the module's documents.\\
If filters run in evaluation mode, an overlay logo will be shown on video.

### Embedding / Customizing nanocosmos technology 

Nanocosmos also offers special OEM and customization service. Dependent on your needs, we may offer different models of licensing or application development.
