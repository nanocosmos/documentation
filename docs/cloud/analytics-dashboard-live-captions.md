# Live Captions

The Live Captions page provides usage analytics for the Live Captions service. It gives you an overview of transcription session uptime, language distribution, and per-stream usage.

:::info
Live Captions must be enabled for your organization before data appears here. To learn how to set up and configure Live Captions, see the [Live Captions setup guide](/docs/dashboard/live_captions).

## Uptime Usage

A stacked bar chart showing total transcription session uptime over the selected time range, broken down by ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) service — **Whisper** and **Deepgram**. Each bar represents one time period; each colored segment corresponds to one service. The top-right corner of the widget shows individual totals for Whisper and Deepgram, as well as the combined total across both services.

:::note
Uptime is measured from the start to the end of a transcription session. Sessions that are still active are not reflected until they end.
:::

Click any bar segment to open a detailed breakdown for that time period and service.

## Source Language

A pie chart showing the distribution of transcription session uptime by **source language** — the spoken language being transcribed by the ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) engine. Each slice displays the percentage share and total uptime (e.g., `2.26 h`), sorted by uptime descending.

Click any slice to drill down into a per-stream uptime breakdown for that language.

## Target Language

A pie chart showing the distribution of transcription session uptime by **target language** — the language into which captions are translated and displayed to viewers (e.g., `en`, `de`, `fr`). Because a single stream can output captions in multiple target languages simultaneously, each language is tracked independently. Sorted by uptime descending.

Click any slice to drill down into a per-stream uptime breakdown for that language.

## Uptime Usage by Stream

A paginated table showing total caption session uptime per stream.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| Stream name | The name of the stream |
| Duration (Hours) | Total uptime of live caption sessions for this stream |

You can search by stream name and sort by either column. The footer shows the total number of streams found.
