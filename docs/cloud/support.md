## Support Options

If you experience any issues or have questions, there are certain ways to do some diagnostics on your end. 
If you do not find a solution, please create a [support ticket](https://www.nanocosmos.de/support).

To check your network connectivity, please read our [network diagnostics](network-diagnostics) information page.

## Live Stream Information

A live stream in nanoStream Cloud is identified by either a bintu stream ID or stream name. 
For any issues you report to us, please add

- the stream name and ID
- your live camera and encoder configuration
- your player page or a link to our demo player
- the time of the issue, UTC time, and if it happens frequently
- your geo location of live encoding and playback
- the result of the [network diagnostics](network-diagnostics)

## Additional information for player issues

- Does the issue happen on all of your test streams and sessions?
- Please check your live encoder configuration: try lower bitrate and keyframe distance 2s

## Test Player

You can use our demo/test player for verifying your playback.

**Example URL**: https://demo1.nanocosmos.de/nanoplayer/release/nanoplayer.html?h5live.server=bintu-play.nanocosmos.de&h5live.rtmp.url=rtmp://localhost/play&h5live.rtmp.streamname=XXXXX-YYYYY

Replace `h5live.rtmp.streamname=XXXXX-YYYYY` with your bintu stream name.

You can also predefine a specific geo location for playback. <br/>
Replace `h5live.server=bintu-play.nanocosmos.de` with one of the locations mentioned below.

:::tip Example playback from US East
Location: `bintu-play-use.nanocosmos.de`
https://demo1.nanocosmos.de/nanoplayer/release/nanoplayer.html?h5live.server=bintu-play-use.nanocosmos.de&h5live.rtmp.url=rtmp://localhost/play&h5live.rtmp.streamname=XXXXX-YYYYY
:::

## Geo Locations

By default, the URLs you get from our system are load-balanced between different geo locations. This means you will land on different servers close to your location.

You can override the geo location detection for both encoding/ingest and playback.

:::info note
In general overriding the default URL is not required and most of the time not recommended.

## nanoStream Cloud Public URLs

### Standard URLs, geo-loadbalanced:

**Playback**: bintu-play.nanocosmos.de <br/>
**Ingest**: bintu-stream.nanocosmos.de
