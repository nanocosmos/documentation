### Live Encoding

Whether you use **software encoders**, **hardware devices**, or **browser-based tools**, nanoStream Cloud makes it simple to go live in real time.

You can ingest streams through popular protocols such as **RTMP**, **SRT**, **WHIP**, and **WebRTC**. nanoStream Cloud integrates easily with industry-standard tools like [OBS](https://www.nanocosmos.net/blog/how-to-use-obs-for-low-latency-live-encoding-to-nanostream-cloud/) or [Osprey Talon](https://www.nanocosmos.net/blog/osprey-talon-and-nanostream-cloud/). For instant browser-based streaming, the **nanoStream Webcaster** lets you broadcast directly without any plugins or third-party software.

This combination of flexibility, ultra-low latency, and browser compatibility makes nanoStream Cloud ideal for interactive applications where speed and simplicity matter most.

### nanoStream Player


Once your stream is live, **nanoStream H5Live Player** ensures your audience receives it instantly, on any device, anywhere in the world. As part of the nanoStream Cloud ecosystem, this browser-based playback solution delivers **ultra-low latency (\<500ms)** with smooth, adaptive performance.

The player automatically adjusts to the viewer’s network conditions using **[Adaptive Bitrate (ABR)](../dashboard/abr_transcoding)**, ensuring continuous playback even under changing connectivity. Developers can easily [embed the player into websites or apps](../dashboard/code_snippets) using a simple JavaScript API, while keeping control over latency, security, and appearance.

The **H5Live Player** is designed for performance, scalability, and brand integration, allowing you to maintain your look and feel while delivering the speed and reliability your users expect.

### nanoStream Analytics

To ensure the best possible live streaming experience, **nanoStream Analytics** provides real-time insight into both **Quality of Service (QoS)** and **Quality of Experience (QoE)**.

With detailed metrics on stream performance, viewer activity, and network behavior, you can identify trends, detect issues early, and make data-driven improvements to your live events. Custom alerts can help you monitor specific streams or regions.
Together with the **nanoStream Guardian**, you can also actively protect your streams by blocking unwanted access, whether by IP, referrer, or entire regions.

### Stream Management: Dashboard & API

All streaming operations can be managed through the **nanoStream Cloud Dashboard** (*which utilizes the bintu API*) or the **bintu API** directly.
This gives you full control over your streaming workflow, whether you prefer an intuitive web interface or direct API integration.
