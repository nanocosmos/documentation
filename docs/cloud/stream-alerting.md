## Introduction
The general purpose of stream alerts is providing more transparent insights about the current live stream performances, estimated causes and possible solutions. Alerts offer mutliple capabilities to take immediate action and therefore improve the streaming experience for your audience.

## Getting started
Stream alerting is activated by default and does not need any action from your side. To be sure if this feature is already available to you, check your nanostream Cloud dashboard's version number. This feature is enabled for dashboard version `3.X.X.X` or higher. To access this feature just visit the alert tab within the dashboard, where the alerts of your current running live streams will be shown (in case the performance of your live streams is generating alerts on different occassions).
