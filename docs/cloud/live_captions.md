:::warning Prerequisites
To make use of **Live Captions**, it must be explicitly enabled for your organization. Activation may be subject to additional pricing or service terms.

You can verify whether this feature is available by navigating to [dashboard.nanostream.cloud/organisation](https://dashboard.nanostream.cloud/organisation) in your dashboard.  
In the **[Enabled Packages](./organization_overview#enabled-packages)** section, locate the entry for `Live Captions`. If it shows **Upgrade needed**, please [contact us](https://www.nanocosmos.net/contact).

:::info Live Caption Security Requirements
Live captions are only available for **secure playback**. Therefore, by enabling `live captions`, you will also need to enable the `secure` feature. Please reach out to our sales team via [nanocosmos.net/contact](https://www.nanocosmos.net/contact) or by email at sales(at)nanocosmos.net if you have any questions. \
To learn more about secure playback, visit the dedicated article [Secure Playback (H5Live)](/docs/cloud/security#secure-playback-h5live).

## Overview

**Live Captions** convert spoken audio into readable text in real time. This AI-driven feature enhances accessibility and content comprehension across a wide range of live-streaming, especially for:
- Events with spoken content
- Viewers in sound-off environments
- Users who are hard of hearing
- Corporate, educational, or public-facing broadcasts

This provides dynamic, accurate, and easy-to-follow text output that helps viewers stay engaged even without audio. Live captions start automatically as soon as the stream becomes active. The first caption lines typically appear within **5–7 seconds**, depending on the selected **ASR engine**. Captions stop automatically when the stream ends.

To ensure low-latency and reliable delivery, all captions are produced and transmitted through a **dedicated real-time output channel**, separate from the video stream.

:::warning Please note  
Live Captions and the caption switcher are **not included in the default H5Live Player UI**. This means: they are **not embedded automatically**.
To allow viewers to enable, disable, or style captions, your playback environment must integrate caption handling explicitly.
For implementation guidance or UI integration examples, please contact our support team via [nanocosmos.net/support](https://www.nanocosmos.net/support)
:::

## How It Works

During an active stream, the audio is forwarded to the selected **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) engine**. The engine converts speech into text and outputs a continuous caption stream. The H5Live Player synchronizes to this caption feed and displays it to viewers in real-time.

:::info Custom set-up for the ASR service
Some of our ASR services require a 24-hour advance notice.
Please contact our sales team via [nanocosmos.net/contact](https://www.nanocosmos.net/contact) to find the best configuration for your business. They will also be happy to give you in-depth advice and recommendations on the ASR types for your use case.

## ASR Engines And Langauges

As already explained earlier, Live Captions rely on **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) engines** to convert spoken audio into real-time text. This section explains which ASR providers are available, how they differ, and which languages they support. You will also learn the difference between **source** and **target** languages and how they are applied during live caption generation.

### Supported ASR Engines

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="deepgram"
  values={[
    {label: 'Deepgram', value: 'deepgram'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem className="tab-item" value="deepgram">
  
  **Deepgram** is an enterprise-grade ASR engine designed for high accuracy and very low latency in real-time captioning. It uses neural-network models optimized for live audio and supports multiple languages for both transcription and live translation.
  </TabItem>
    <TabItem className="tab-item" value="whisper">

    **Whisper** is an open-source ASR system developed by OpenAI.
    It offers robust multilingual speech recognition and performs well across diverse audio conditions.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Supported Languages 

The *source language* is **the spoken language of the incoming audio**. This language is used by the ASR engine to interpret the speech and generate text. The *target language* defines **the output language of the captions**. Only engines that support translation can provide multiple output languages.

:::note Region-specific language codes
Some ASR engines offer region-specific language codes (e.g. **es-419** for *Latin American Spanish*).
Use these variants when **your target audience is primarily from a specific region** and you want **improved recognition of regional accents, vocabulary, and spelling conventions**.

If you do not require a regional focus, the generic language code (e.g. **es**) is typically sufficient.

## Managing Live Captions

There are two different ways to integrate live captions into streams: via the nanoStream Cloud Dashboard or directly via the bintu API.

To use captions, you must first create a stream. See the stream creation guides:

    </Card>
  </Columns>
</article>


### Dashboard Integration

Live Captions can be configured directly through the **nanoStream Dashboard**. \
The workflow during the *Stream Creation* in the UI is designed to be simple and intuitive:

1. Select the **Live Captions engine**.
2. Choose a **source language** (speech input).
3. Choose one or more **target languages** (caption output).
4. Save your configuration.

![Screenshot: Adding live captions during stream creation](../assets/dashboard/create-add-captions.png)
*Screenshot: Adding live captions during stream creation*

A detailed guide with screenshots on how to manage streams with live captions is available in the [**Live Captions in the Dashboard**](/docs/dashboard/live_captions) documentation.

:::tip Accessing Live Captions Management  
The **Live Captions** configuration can be created, edited, or removed in multiple dashboard locations:

- During stream creation: [dashboard.nanostream.cloud/stream/create](https://dashboard.nanostream.cloud/stream/create)
- Later via the Stream Overview tab **Live Captions** tab, which can be found:
  - **Stream Overview**: [dashboard.nanostream.cloud/stream/YOUR-STREAM-ID/live-captions](https://dashboard.nanostream.cloud/stream/YOUR-STREAM-ID/live-captions)
  - **Playout Overview**: [dashboard.nanostream.cloud/playout/YOUR-STREAM-ID/live-captions](https://dashboard.nanostream.cloud/playout/YOUR-STREAM-ID/live-captions)
  - **Webcaster Overview**: [dashboard.nanostream.cloud/webcaster/YOUR-STREAM-ID](https://dashboard.nanostream.cloud/webcaster/YOUR-STREAM-ID)
:::

:::warning good to know
You can modify live captions settings at any time. **However, it’s important to note that the stream must be re-ingested for the changes to take effect.**
:::

### API Integration

Live Captions are controlled via **Stream Options**, managed through the bintu API.

You can access the requests with the following permission level:

|<span className="role role-admin">nanoAdmin</span>|<span className="role role-user">nanoUser</span>|<span className="role role-readonly">nanoReadOnly</span>|
|---|---|---|
| ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |

**Supported API actions**

- [`POST`](https://doc.pages.nanocosmos.de/bintuapi-docs/#tag/Stream-Options/paths/~1stream~1{id}~1options/post) → Add live captions to a stream
- [`GET`](https://doc.pages.nanocosmos.de/bintuapi-docs/#tag/Stream-Options/paths/~1stream~1{id}~1options/get) → Retrieve current caption settings
- [`PUT`](https://doc.pages.nanocosmos.de/bintuapi-docs/#tag/Stream-Options/paths/~1stream~1{id}~1options/put) → Update existing settings
- [`DELETE`](https://doc.pages.nanocosmos.de/bintuapi-docs/#tag/Stream-Options/paths/~1stream~1{id}~1options/delete) → Remove live captions settings

**Parameters**

**Body**
- `NAME`: must always be set to `"captions"` to enable Live Captions for the stream.
- `OPTIONS`: Contains all configuration options for the caption engine, this includes: `engine`, `sourceLanguage`, `targetLanguage` (optional)

```html title="bintu/post_stream_options.sh"
curl --request POST \
  --url https://bintu.nanocosmos.de/stream/%7Bid%7D/options \
  --header 'X-BINTU-APIKEY: REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"name":"captions","options":{"engine":"deepgram","sourceLanguage":"en"}}'
```

:::note Advanced Developer bintu API docs
For additional languages, advanced configuration options, and complete request/response samples, please refer to the official **bintu API documentation**: [doc.pages.nanocosmos.de/bintuapi-docs](https://doc.pages.nanocosmos.de/bintuapi-docs). \
