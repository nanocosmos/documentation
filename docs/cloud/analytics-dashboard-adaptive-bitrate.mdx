# Adaptive Bitrate (ABR)

If you have ABR enabled and you successfully configured transcoding profiles for your live streams, you will see data within the ABR tab of the Analytics Dashboard.

### Profile Details
The ABR profiles represent different resolutions for the playback, based on the video height (e.g. 360p, 720p, 1080p):

#### Playtime per Profile
- playtime per resoultion, ranked by longest playtime

#### Viewer Count per Profile
- active viewers per profile (not concurrent viewers)

### Profile Switch Details
Insights for the ABR profile switches provide useful information to determine general stream or bandwidth quality:

#### Success Rate
- relation between successed and failed up and down profile switches

#### Up and Down Switches
- more distinct insights of different profile switch categories (e.g. only up or down switches)
