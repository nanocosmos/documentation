## Playouts

After selecting a specific time period you are asked to enter an IP address or an user ID to access playout statistics about all streams that this user retrieved. You will then be able to select one out of the 5 newest playouts based on their start date. To view more than these 5 results you need to adjust the time range accordingly. We also implemented support for currently running playouts.

:::tip note
Only organizations with player metrics option enabled will be able to see the items in this data group.

(A) `From (UTC Time)` the **start** of the time range to search in.

(B) `To (UTC Time)` the **end** of the time range to search in.

(C) `By` indicates the time interval granularity. It can be 30 seconds or 1 minute.

(D) `Playout` tab which selects to view playout statistics. Playout statistics for all streams in the selected time period are retrieved.

(E) `End to End` tab which selects to view both playout and ingest statistics in the same page. Playout and ingest statistics for all streams in the selected time period are retrieved.

(F) `Ingest` tab which selects to view ingest statistics. Ingest statistics for all streams in the selected time period are retrieved.

(G) `Copy URL to share` will copy the current page setup to clipboard. Users can send this URL to nanocosmos support for further troubleshooting help.

(H) `IP address/user ID` specifies either the IP address used in client playouts or user IDs to search for related streams.

:::info note
To make this work with user IDs, you have to assign IDs to your users beforehand and also transmit that to the [player API](../nanoplayer/nanoplayer_player_metrics#how-to-use).
:::

(I) `Select a stream` shows all streams that has a playout related to the IP address or user ID set earlier.
    
#### Stream Playout Information

If there are metrics available for the selected IP/ user ID within the stated time period, a list of streams viewed by this user is shown. Select the desired stream name to see a list of all playouts for this stream. After you selected a playout more detailed information are shown. Define the time interval with the slider to zoom into streams with a longer duration or to focus on specific parts of the stream. At this point you can synchronize with the corresponding ingest data of the playout on the right side.

#### Stream Time Ratio

The stream time ratio (STR) represents the relation between the elapsed real time and the stream time within an interval of 15 seconds. A constant ratio value of 1 would be ideal - but a small fluctuation is expected. A big fluctuation or deviation from the value 1 indicates issues on the ingest side, for instance caused by a limited bandwidth or high CPU load. The higher the deviation from the value 1, the higher the probability for an increased latency on the playback/viewer side.

<ScaledImage image="str_normal.png" alt="Normal STR Example" widthScaling="50" title="Regular Stream Time Ratio" 
    description="In this example you can see a regular course of the STR metric. If you take a closer look at the beginning of the stream, you will notice an increasement in the first 30 seconds, which is intended behavior and does not generate an alert. Sometimes the ingest stream takes a bit to run stable and little fluctuations are considered as regular conditions." />

<ScaledImage image="str_drops.png" alt="Drop STR Example" widthScaling="50" title="Stream Time Ratio with Drops" 
    description="This example shows some kind of edge case. If the stream time ratio indicates spikes, it can be a hint for possible issues. Nevertheless if the stream does recover quickly enough, there is nothing to worry about. The constant fluctuations are sometimes dipping below 0.9, but will be okay, since the average value will be above this threshold." />

<ScaledImage image="str_fluc_recover.png" alt="Fluctuation STR Example" widthScaling="50" title="Temporary fluctuating Stream Time Ratio" 
    description="In this case you can observe a highly fluctating moment of an ingest stream, which does recover after a while. This is a good example for stream behavior that might generate an alert within the first minutes, but will recover by itself afterwards. The reason behind the fluctuation could be bandwith issues or encoder instability." />


#### Visualizations 

Define the time interval with the slider to zoom into streams with a longer duration or to focus on specific parts of the stream. The results you get for the ingest stream name are also sorted by newest first as for the playouts. Selecting a time period auto-refreshes the statistics below.

> **RTMP Ingests**

Ingests using RTMP only provide metrics about video and audio bitrates.

![Screenshot: Troubleshoot Ingest RTMP](../assets/analytics/tp-ingest-rtmp.png)
*Screenshot: Troubleshoot Ingest RTMP*

- `Video bitrate` [kBits/s]: Video bitrate of the ingested stream.

- `Audio bitrate` [kBits/s]: Audio bitrate of the ingested stream.

<br/>

> **WebRTC Ingests**

Ingests using Web Real Time Communication are providing additional insights to framerate, encoding and package delivery.

:::info note
To have [WebRTC metric](./analytics#webcaster) data available for the Troubleshooting page, they need to be enabled.
:::

![Screenshot: Troubleshoot Ingest Webcaster](../assets/analytics/tp-ingest-webrtc.png)
*Screenshot: Troubleshoot Ingest Webcaster* 

- `Video bitrate` [kBits/s]: Video bitrate of the ingested stream.

- `Audio bitrate` [kBits/s]: Audio bitrate of the ingested stream.

- `Framerate` [fps]: Framerate of the ingested stream.

- `Average frame encode time` [ms]: The average time needed to encode one frame of the stream.
   
:::caution Long encode time
Note that a long encode time is an indicator for high encoder workload, which can lead to ingest problems. 
:::

- `Count of packet loss detections`: Amount of WebRTC notifications about lost data packages.

:::caution High count of lost packages
Note, a high count of lost packages at a time can lead to issues with the video representation on the side of the end user.

#### Other Samples

> **Video only ingest workflow**

The figure below shows the graphical representation.
In this scenario, only video bitrate data can be observed, while audio bitrate is not available.
Also, the detected video bitrate is about 1 Mbps and this can be checked against settings on ingest encoder.

![Screenshot: Video Only](../assets/analytics/tp-video-only.png)
*Screenshot: Video Only*

> **Audio only ingest workflow**

The figure below shows the graphical representation.
In this scenario, only audio bitrate data can be observed, while video bitrate is not available.
Similarly, the detected audio bitrate is averaging above 25Kbps and this can be checked against settings on ingest encoder.

![Screenshot: Audio Only Ingest Workflow](../assets/analytics/tp-audio-only.png)
*Screenshot: Audio Only Ingest Workflow*

> **Audio/Video ingest workflow in good condition**

The figure below shows the graphical representation.
As can be observed, the average video bitrate is about 1.2Mbps while audio bitrate is about 90Kbps. The video and audio bitrates do not deviate too much from the average over time and will not cause overflow or underflow of buffers.

![Screenshot Audio/Video Ingest Workflow in good condition](../assets/analytics/tp-ingest-rtmp.png)
*Screenshot Audio/Video Ingest Workflow in good condition*

> **Audio/Video ingest workflow with network issues**

The figure below shows the graphical representation.
As can be observed, the average video bitrate is about 2Mbps while audio bitrate is about 150Kbps. Towards the end of the graph as highlighted by the red box, the video and audio bitrates fluctuate by more than 50% of the average. This signifies some issues with the ingest from the encoder to nanocosmos CDN. Some causes of these could be ISP related network degradation or encoding anomalies. If this issue is not rectified quickly, then it will cause overflow or underflow of buffers resulting in buffering, connection issues, etc.
