description: Step-by-step onboarding to create, broadcast and monitor your first live stream with nanoStream Cloud (bintu). Includes detailed instructions for nanoStream Webcaster, OBS and Osprey Talon.
---

This guide walks you through everything required to get your **first live stream** running on **nanoStream Cloud**.  
You will learn how to:

- create and manage streams with **bintu** (Dashboard or API),  
- push live video from the **browser (nanoStream Webcaster)**, **OBS**, or **Osprey Talon**, and  
- validate playback with the **H5Live** player and analytics.

:::info Before starting
If you don’t have an account yet you can [sign up](https://dashboard.nanostream.cloud/signup), or get in touch with our sales team via [nanocosmos.net/contact](https://www.nanocosmos.net/contact) or by email at sales(at)nanocosmos.net.

*Need help accessing an existing organization or unsure how to proceed?* <br/>
👉 Check the [Authentication section](#authentication) in our docs for step-by-step guidance on creating an account, logging in or requesting access from your system administrator.
:::

## Quick start

1. Sign up / log in to the Dashboard: [dashboard.nanostream.cloud/](https://dashboard.nanostream.cloud/)
2. Create a new stream in the Dashboard (or via the bintu API).  
3. Copy the **Ingest URL** and **Stream name**.  
4. Start your encoder (nanoStream Webcaster / OBS / Osprey / ...) and paste the ingest details.  
5. Open the **Playback URL** in a browser and share it with your audience.

## Prerequisite

To get started with the **nanoStream Cloud Dashboard** or **bintu REST API**, sign in to the nanoStream Cloud Dashboard with your *nanoStream Cloud account*, as you will either need your **API Key** or **bintu token**.

To create and broadcast a live stream, you need your *live event or content* and *equipment to capture it*.
This can either be a **webcam**, an **external camera**, a **streaming device**, or even **your PC screen**. You'll also need streaming software or hardware or simply your browser.

:::tip Find your Api Key / Bintu Token
If you plan to use the **REST API**, you'll need the **API Key / Bintu Token**, available in the Dashboard under your organization's settings: [dashboard.nanostream.cloud/organisation/overview](https://dashboard.nanostream.cloud/organisation/overview). 
*Only* <span className="role role-admin">nanoAdmin</span> *have permission to access **API keys**.*

## Create a Stream

A new stream can be created via the dashboard or via the Rest API. It is possible to create a stream with different settings. You can either create a single stream or a multi-bitrate stream.

:::info Good to know
A **multi-bitrate stream (MBR)** is transcoded into streams of varying quality to enable the playback of streams with extremely low latency at low bandwidth.

To understand *what multi-bitrate streams are* and *how adaptive bitrate and live transcoding work*, take a look at our [dedicated explanation page](/docs/dashboard/abr_transcoding).
:::

### Permission Overview

It is possible to create a stream with the following roles:

|<span className="role role-admin">nanoAdmin</span>|<span className="role role-user">nanoUser</span>|<span className="role role-readonly">nanoReadOnly</span>|
