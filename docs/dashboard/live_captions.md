**Live Captions** convert speech into readable text in multiple languages in real time to support accessibility and compliance. This feature improves accessibility and keeps viewers engaged, especially for streams with spoken content, in sound-off environments, or for users who are hard of hearing.

Through the **nanoStream Cloud Dashboard**, you can easily set up, manage, and integrate Live Captions into your playback environment. This guide explains how to enable, configure, and use Live Captions from within the dashboard.

## Add Live Captions to a New Stream

When creating a new stream in the dashboard, live captions can be configured directly.

*Screenshot: Adding live captions during stream creation*

First, select the desired live caption engine. Then specify the language of the audio  (i.e., the language spoken during the stream). Next, select one or more target languages in which the captions should be displayed. Live Captions support translation and can output text in multiple target languages simultaneously.\
Once the engine and languages are configured, click **Create stream**, this saves the settings as part of the stream configuration. From that point, Live Captions will automatically activate as soon as the stream goes live, with the first lines typically appearing within 5–7 seconds.

## Overview of Live Captions Setup

After creating a stream, you can access **Live Captions** playout and code snippets in several dashboard locations:

- **Stream Overview:** [dashboard.nanostream.cloud/stream/YOUR-STREAM-ID](https://dashboard.nanostream.cloud/stream/YOUR-STREAM-ID)
- **New Stream Instructions:** [dashboard.nanostream.cloud/stream/new/YOUR-STREAM-ID](https://dashboard.nanostream.cloud/stream/new/YOUR-STREAM-ID)
- **Playout Overview:** [dashboard.nanostream.cloud/playout/YOUR-STREAM-ID](https://dashboard.nanostream.cloud/playout/YOUR-STREAM-ID)
- **Webcaster Overview:** [dashboard.nanostream.cloud/webcaster/YOUR-STREAM-ID](https://dashboard.nanostream.cloud/webcaster/YOUR-STREAM-ID)

In all these areas (except **New Stream Instructions**), you’ll find a dedicated **Live Captions tab**, which includes:

- **Live Captions Player**.
- **Language selector** below the player to switch between enabled target languages.
- Current **engine**, **source language**, and **target language(s)**.
- Options to **add**, **edit**, or **remove** captions.
- **Secure Playback Token** with decoded informations.
- **Captions Playout** URLs for each target language.
