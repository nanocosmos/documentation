nanoStream offers two ways to start streaming:
1. **[Using nanoStream Webcaster](#ingesting-with-the-nanostream-webcaster)** 
2. **[Using an external live encoder](#ingesting-with-a-separate-live-encoder-software-or-hardware)**

Regardless of the method, you first need to create a stream.

### Transcoding Profile(s)

During the stream creation process live transcoding is already enabled by default. You have the option to add transcoding profiles and configure them according to your requirements. The default selection is pre-filled, but you can choose different settings. Ensure that the bitrate of each Transcoding Profile is lower than the ingest/passthrough bitrate or the profile above.

:::info Learn more about ABR & Live Transcoding
Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) and Live Transcoding work together to ensure seamless playback quality, even under unstable network conditions.
- **ABR** automatically switches between multiple stream qualities depending on the viewerâ€™s bandwidth.
- **Live Transcoding** creates these multiple stream outputs from a single high-quality input.

ðŸ‘‰ Dive into the [Adaptive Bitrate and Transcoding section](./abr_transcoding) to understand how it works and when to use it.

:::tip Manage your Transcoding Profiles
As your streaming requirements evolve, you may find the need to revise your transcoding profiles. You can fully manage your stream profiles within the [Stream Overview](./stream_overview).
Check [**Modifying Transcoding Profiles After Stream Creation**](./abr_transcoding#modifying-transcoding-profiles-after-stream-creation) for detailed steps and UI walkthroughs.
