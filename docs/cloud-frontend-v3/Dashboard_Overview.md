These features enable you to efficiently manage and navigate through your streams, providing a clear and organized overview of your streaming content within the nanoStream Cloud Dashboard.

## Stream Creation

The nanoStream Cloud Dashboard offers a straightforward process for creating a new stream with various customization options. 

> [Click here ](https://dashboard.nanostream.cloud/stream/create)to create a stream.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Access the nanoStream Cloud Dashboard and navigate to the stream creation section.
2. You have the option to add stream tags. You can either manually enter tags or choose from your existing ones, making it easier to categorize and identify your streams.
3. For enhanced streaming quality, you have the option to configure transcoding profiles. You can define up to three profiles that enable Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) streaming. These profiles provide multiple quality versions of the stream, ensuring optimal playback across different network conditions.
4. The dashboard also offers advanced features like `timecode` and `live processing`, but please note that these features are available as paid options. Timecodes allow precise synchronization or indexing of video content, while live processing enables real-time modifications or effects during the streaming process.

By following these steps, you can create a new stream using the nanoStream Cloud Dashboard, assign tags for easy identification, configure transcoding profiles for Adaptive Bitrate streaming, and optionally activate advanced features like timecodes and live processing.

In order to send a live stream to the nanoStream Cloud, you will require a Live Encoder. This can be accomplished using industry-standard software like OBS, dedicated hardware encoders, or even a web page equipped with the [nanoStream Webcaster.](https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/webrtc/nanostream_webrtc_introduction)

## Instructions to start a stream

To initiate a stream using the nanoStream Cloud Dashboard, you can access the "Instructions to start a stream" page either after creating a stream or through the regular stream overview page. This page provides you with all the information required to begin streaming, including the necessary steps and details for a seamless setup.

On this page, you'll find all the essential information required to begin your stream. The information is presented in three sections:

1. **Start the Ingest**: Here, you'll find the ingest details, including the RTMP stream name and RTMP URL. To easily copy these details, simply click on the copy icon provided at the end of the row.
2. **Access the Web Playout**: In this section, you'll discover the live playout URL. Clicking on it will also reveal a code snippet. This code snippet contains everything you need to embed the H5Live Player with your stream onto your web page.
> Additionally, the dashboard offers the `secure` option (if enabled) to generate a playback token. During your logged-in session, you have a jwt token that is valid for the whole organisation and lets you watch every stream. Alternatively, you can create a new stream JWT token with an expiration date. This token can be valid for the entire organization, specific stream groups, or individual stream names. You can specify options such as "not before" date, client IP, domain, user ID, or a single tag for added security and control. Contact us [here](https://www.nanocosmos.de/contact) to enable the `secure` feature for you!
3. **Stream Overvie**w: This section provides a link to the stream's overview page. By clicking on the URL, you can access the complete stream overview, which includes various other relevant details.
