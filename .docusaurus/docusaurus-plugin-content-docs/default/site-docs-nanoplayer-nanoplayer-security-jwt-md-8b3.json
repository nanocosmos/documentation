  "description": "Since nanoStream H5Live Player Version 4.18.0 it is possible to use JSON Web Token (JWT) for a secure playback for all use cases. It can be applied with the entries configuration and with the group configuration. Contrary to the STS secure configuration, there can be single JWT token for all streams within the stream group. It is now easier than ever to use live transcoding and ABR with ultra-low-latency live streaming.",
