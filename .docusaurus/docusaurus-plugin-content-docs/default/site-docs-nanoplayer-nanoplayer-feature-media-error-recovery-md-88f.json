  "description": "With the nanoStream H5Live Player Version 4.10.4 an automatic recovery workflow was introduced, meaning that for certain media errors which might occur during playback, the recovery will be triggered.  In this way, even if there is a disturbance during media decoding, playback resumes automatically. This feature brings a better experience for users.",
